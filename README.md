# My APCSA Code

This is a repo of all of my APCSA code, mainly for labs. Make sure not to copy line for line, just use this as inspiration of sorts.

## Note To Self:

To run code on terminal:

rm -rf *Chapter#*/*Name of Project*/\*.class

cd *Chapter#*/*Name of Project* && javac *

cd $HOME/Coding/APCSA/src

java *Chapter#*/*Name of Project*/*The file which actually runs (aka the one with psvm)*
